            <p>Research in visual perception suggests that humans may process images up to 60,000 times faster than text, a concept leveraged in advertising and media.</p>
            <p>And yet, sometimes, words themselves can paint the most vivid picture. Words can express complex or abstract information in a way images cannot. Sometimes we need both.</p>
            <p>If any picture was always worth 1,000 words, we wouldn’t need to write much to create our presentations. We could just collect pictures and nod along. Obviously, words, spoken or written, do have a power that pictures lack.</p>
            <p>To delve deeper into the interplay between images and language, we need to understand how they collaborate to express emotions and convey narratives. Specifically, we will explore when to use pictures, when to use words, and when it’s effective to use both.</p>

                 <h2>The Power of Visuals</h2>
                 <p>Strong visuals have an undeniably powerful impact on presentation and storytelling. Meaningful images grab your attention and evoke strong emotional responses. Today, it’s easy to snap a clear photo and make it look good in Photoshop. What makes a good image is still not mainly a technical matter. Even grainy or blurry shots can tell a strong tale.

                    The issue with saying “a picture is worth a thousand words” is it sets up a false battle between words and images. It suggests one image can match, replace, or outdo the impact of words.
                    
                    Words and images function differently; they communicate in distinct ways and have their unique capacities for conveying nuance, detail, and emotion.</p>

            <h2>The Relationship Between
                Text and Visuals</h2>
            <p>While images can instantly evoke feelings or set a scene, they lack the specificity and explanatory power that words can provide. While words can be precise and informative, they might not capture the immediacy or emotional resonance that a well-chosen image can deliver.

                Instead of pitching images and text against each other, we need to learn when to use which, and how to use both images and words to strengthen each other. Using your text and visuals in a way that complements each other can make or break the story you’re trying to tell.
                
                Images and words are different forms of language. One can express that which the other cannot. The key to a strong presentation is to use them together and complement their strengths.</p>

        <p>Ironically, the phrase “A picture is worth 1,000 words” doesn’t come close to showing the whole picture. Text and image content both have their strengths and limitations.

            Pictures have an impact when they tell a story that only a picture can tell. Choose your images as carefully as you chose your words.</p> </section>
